# Project-1-XI
My first project in data analysis bootcamp. In this project, I work as a Data Analyst for Microsoft to make recommendations for a new business expansion in movie and film making. The task is to guide the head of Microsoft in informed decisions on which type of films to produce, ensuring a competitive edge in the market.
